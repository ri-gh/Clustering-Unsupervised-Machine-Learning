# Clustering-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
Project on K-means &amp; DBScan Clustering

Uber is one of the most famous startup in the world.

One of the main pain point that Uber's team found is that sometimes drivers are not around when users need them.
Eventhough both neighborhood are not that far away, users would still have to wait 10 to 15 minutes before being picked-up, which is too long. Uber's research shows that users accept to wait 5-7 minutes, otherwise they would cancel their ride.

Therefore, Uber's data team would like to work on a project where their app would recommend hot-zones in major cities to be in at any given time of day.

Uber already has data about pickups in major cities. Your objective is to create algorithms that will determine where are the hot-zones that drivers should be in. Therefore you will:

- Create an algorithm to find hot zones

- Visualize results on a nice dashboard

To start off, Uber wants to try this feature in New York city.

Deliverable ðŸ“¬
To complete this project, your team should:


* Have a map with hot-zones using any python library (plotly or anything else).

* You should at least describe hot-zones per day of week.

* Compare results with at least two unsupervised algorithms like KMeans and DBScan.

You can find datas in file "uber-raw-data-apr14.csv"

Plot of the DBScan clustering can be seen on the png file.
